* I am a PhD candidate in the Materials Engineering Department at Delft University of Technology (TUD)

* Supervised by Prof. [Hans Hopman](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/j.j.hopman/?cHash=2bb7c806023d588d9fe61e6db2281977) and Dr. [Xiaoli Jiang](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/x.jiang/), my PhD project addressed:

*An effective modelling method based on multi-scale analysis*

*Initial residual contact stresses among the interfaces in power cables*

*Stick-slip issue among interfaces*

*Multi-physical study based on the proposed model*

* Priori to joining TUD, I received my master's degree in the College of Civil Engineering at Zhejiang University in 2019, supervised by Prof. [Yong Bai](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0010294). My master project addressed:

*Development of a constitutive model for fiber glass reinforced flexible pipes*

*Fracture analysis of fibreglass flexible pipes*

*Torsion strength of unbonded steel strip flexible pipes*

*Stick-slip issue among interfaces in unbonded flexible pipes*



Research interests
======

*Multi-scale analysis, Solid structures, Composite structures, Computational mechanics, Finite element analysis, Multi-physical analysis*
