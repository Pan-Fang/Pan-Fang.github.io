* My research lies at the intersection of Applied Mechanics, Ocean Engineering, and Advanced Manufacturing. I focus on decoding the multiphysics instability of slender structures—specifically submarine power cables and flexible risers—to ensure the reliability of the global Net Zero energy transition.

 *Currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at Ghent University, I am pioneering a hybrid approach that combines thermo-mechanical coupled modelling with novel experimental frameworks (leveraging additive manufacturing and tomography). My work aims to unravel complex phenomena such as topological mode transitions and contact-driven hysteresis in hierarchical helical systems. By integrating theoretical depth with industrial relevance, I strive to advance the fundamental understanding of how critical marine infrastructure behaves in deep-water environments.

* I hold a PhD degree in the Mechanical, Materials and Maritime Engineering Department (3ME) at Delft University of Technology (TUD), supervised by Prof. [Hans Hopman](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/j.j.hopman/?cHash=2bb7c806023d588d9fe61e6db2281977) and Dr. [Xiaoli Jiang](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/x.jiang/). My PhD project addressed:

  *An effective modelling method based on multi-scale analysis*

  *Initial residual contact stresses among the interfaces in power cables*

  *Stick-slip issue among interfaces*

  *Multi-physical study based on the proposed model*

* I received my master's degree in the College of Civil Engineering at Zhejiang University in 2019, supervised by Prof. [Yong Bai](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0010294#0). My master project addressed:

  *Development of a constitutive model for fiber glass reinforced flexible pipes*

  *Fracture analysis of fibreglass flexible pipes*

  *Torsion strength of unbonded steel strip flexible pipes*

  *Stick-slip issue among interfaces in unbonded flexible pipes*
